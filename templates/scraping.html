        Scraping
    </h1>
    <p>
        Sometimes there comes a time when you want to automate an action, and there isn't an API, or perhaps the API
        is very limited, (Facebook and LinkedIn, I'm looking at you). When that happens, you can either say, "Oh well,
        I guess I'll do something else", or you can stop being a quitter for once in your life and scrape the site and
        automate browser input with tools like Mechanize or Selenium.
    </p>
    <p>
        I know, I know. Scraping is bad and only mean people do it. Well, that may be true, but when I set out to do a
        task, I don't let things like 'Partner Programs' or lack of consideration from certain sites hold me back. If I
        want to programatically check my bank balances, or delete 50k terrible group members from my Facebook group
        (after spamming them with hundreds of pseudo biblical posts about the coming of the BanBot) because they can't
        follow a simple set of rules, I'm going to do it. (And I have)
    </p>
    <p>
        Scraping is a little hacky and it is prone to breakage any time there is an update to the front end of the
        site, but it can be a very valuable tool, even if it does break every couple of weeks. There are countless
        tedious tasks that can be automated to your advantage with scraping. A retailer could monitor prices on a
        competitor site and send automated social media posts or emails that undercut the competitor's price. Scraping
        can monitor sites for bad reviews on a product or business so you can get a jump on customer satisfaction. The
        only limit to what you can scrape or bot is your imagination (and the occasional captcha)

            Python is a truly wonderful language. When somebody comes up with a good idea it takes about 1 minute
            and five lines to program something that almost does what you want. Then it takes only an hour to extend
            the script to 300 lines, after which it still does almost what you want.
