        RESTful API
    </h1>

    <p>
        This is a very simple API I constructed to serve some JSON. There really isn't much on the backend here,
        I just wanted to demonstrate a simple RESTful service that I built from scratch. If needed, we could do any
        amount of heavy lifting on the back end, crunching numbers, SQL queries and joins, or whatever else would fill
        a need. For ease of use, I'm not using any authentication here, so you can just test the API calls with curl,
        or just use your browser.
    </p>
    <h3 class="double-pad-top">Weather:</h3>
    <p>
        To check your local weather, you can just curl "localhost:5000/api/weather/'your zip code here'. Conversely,
        you can just click my example link <a href="/api/weather/77573">localhost:5000/api/weather/77573</a> to get an
        example response in the browser. You will get a JSON response for zip code you request.
    </p>
    <h3 class="double-pad-top">Fibonacci:</h3>
    <p>
        To return a fibonacci number (or series of fibonacci numbers), curl "localhost:5000/api/fibonacci/'integer or
        range'. You can also use my example link<a href="/api/fibonacci/1-10">
        localhost:5000/api/fibonacci/1-10</a> in the browser to return the first 10 fibonacci numbers.
    </p>
